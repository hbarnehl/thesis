# Measuring Media Capture Strategies in Authoritarian States

This repository contains the code used in my master's thesis project, whose objective it was to develop a new methodology to measure authoritarian media capture. The Jupyter Notebooks folder contains the python code used for scraping of the data from Nicaraguan news outlets, preprocessing and tokenization of the data, sentiment analysis of mentions of the regime, and visualisations of the results. R was used to run the Structural Topic Model by Roberts et al.
